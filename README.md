# FieldEmbryoCam

The FieldEmbryoCam is an instrument for longterm timelapse imaging of developing aquatic embryos in the environment, alongside logging from environmental sensors such as temperature, or pressure. It supports data transmission via MQTT using the GSM network, and data dashboards using the Thingsboard IOT platform are developed. The instrument runs using the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 single board computers, and is powered by nine D-cell batteries and a Lithium Polymer battery. Deep sleep and waking are achieved using the PiJuice Zero Real Time Clock and power management board.
