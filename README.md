The FieldEmbryoCam is an instrument for longterm timelapse imaging of developing aquatic embryos in the environment, alongside logging from environmental sensors such as temperature, or pressure. It supports data transmission via MQTT using the GSM network, and data dashboards using the Thingsboard IOT platform are developed. The instrument runs using the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 single board computers, and is powered by nine D-cell batteries and a Lithium Polymer battery. Deep sleep and waking are achieved using the PiJuice Zero Real Time Clock and power management board.

FieldEmbryoCam encompasses both an opensource hardware platform and Python module. A full bill of materials and build guide are provided and all 3D printable STL files are provided for would-be users to manafacture their own instruments.
